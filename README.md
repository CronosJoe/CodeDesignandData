Hey! This is my readme for my assessment that isn't complete yet...

Here is what I have done! The hashing and double linked lists are both done but do not have exes made for them yet, after working through this project and dealing with life these last two weeks I couldn't think straight this last day and couldn't even recall how to instantiate a class object but by the time I was struggling with this the test methods I had been using to test my functions had already been deleted for my exe...

so to sum it up
Double linked lists - functions done, exe not
Binary Tree - all the functions are done, missing the copy constructor and the = operator, also don't have an exe
Hashing - all functions are done, missing exe

my github repo for version control

note the commits might look a bit weird cause I had to switch computers partway into work so the github names are different 
in the commits but it was all me!

this was made using visual studio 2019
